# Data Science Internship Projects – Cognifyz Technologies  

## 📌 About the Internship  
This repository showcases the projects I completed during my **Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**, a leading company specializing in AI, ML, and data analytics solutions.  
The internship provided me with the opportunity to apply data science techniques to real-world datasets, strengthen my analytical skills, and deliver actionable insights.  

I successfully completed tasks across **Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3**, which involved data preprocessing, descriptive analysis, geospatial analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and visualization.

## 🚀 Internship Tasks & Contributions  

### 🔹 Level 1: Data Exploration & Analysis  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Explored the dataset, identified missing values, handled nulls, and performed data type conversions.  
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Computed statistical measures (mean, median, std. dev.), analyzed categorical variables (`Country Code`, `City`, `Cuisines`), and identified top cuisines and cities.  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Visualized restaurant locations using latitude and longitude, analyzed city-wise distribution, and explored correlations with ratings.  

### 🔹 Level 2: Advanced Analysis  
- **Table Booking & Online Delivery**: Analyzed the percentage of restaurants offering these services, compared ratings, and studied delivery availability across price ranges.  
- **Price Range Analysis**: Identified common price ranges, calculated average ratings per range, and evaluated color representations for ratings.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features such as `Has Table Booking`, `Has Online Delivery`, and extracted insights from restaurant name/address lengths.  

### 🔹 Level 3: Predictive Modeling & Insights  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Built regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict restaurant ratings. Evaluated performance using metrics and compared algorithm efficiency.  
- **Customer Preference Analysis**: Studied cuisine popularity based on votes and identified cuisines with higher ratings.  
- **Data Visualization**: Created visual dashboards (histograms, bar plots, etc.) to compare cuisines, cities, and their impact on restaurant ratings.
